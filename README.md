# MENTORA
**Description:**
A Java-based application that helps students track study habits, skill development, and learning goals.
Users can log study/skill sessions, monitor progress, and stay motivated with insights & motivational quotes.

**Problem Statement:**
Many students struggle to track their study time, skill development, and consistency. 
Without proper tracking, they lose motivation and fail to achieve learning milestonesðŸš¹.

**Target Users:**
College students
Self-learners
Professionals developing new skills 

**OOP Concepts in Mentora**
*Encapsulation ==> Where we use it: In classes like User, Session, and Goal, we keep variables private:
Purpose:
Protects data from direct modification.
Example: A user cannot directly set hours = -5. Instead, they must call setHours(), where we can validate input.
This ensures data security and correctness in Mentora.

*Inheritance ==> Where we use it: StudySession and SkillSession both inherit from the base Session class.
Purpose:
Avoids code duplication â†’ common fields like sessionId, date, and hours are in Session.
Specific behavior is added in child classes â†’ StudySession may track subject, while SkillSession may track skill type.
Makes Mentora scalable if later we add more session types (like "WorkoutSession").

*Polymorphism==>Where we use it: Both StudySession and SkillSession override the method getSummary().
Purpose:
The same method name behaves differently based on object type.
Provides flexibility â†’ Mentora can treat all sessions as Session but still display custom summaries.

*Abstraction==>Where we use it: The Session class can be abstract since we never create a raw "Session", only specific ones like StudySession or SkillSession.
Purpose:
Hides unnecessary details and forces child classes to implement important methods.
Makes Mentoraâ€™s design clean and enforceable â€” every type of session must define how its summary is shown.
